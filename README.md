# Kade's Dotfiles

This is all of my configuration files.

## Installation

I am using GNU Stow to manage these.

With the repo cloned into the home directory, the configs can be installed via:

```bash
stow nvim tmux zsh wezterm vim skhd scripts nix-darwin kitty alacritty karabiner starship vim yazi
```
